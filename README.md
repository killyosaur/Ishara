# ishara

a blog app that I am using as a way to muck around with react, redux, arangodb, nodejs, docker, and whatever other technologies I feel like

The base applicaton was derived from this blog: https://blog.cloudboost.io/learn-how-to-create-a-simple-blog-with-react-node-c05fa6889de3.
(it is sometimes good to have a starting point just to wrap one's head around new concepts. :P )
